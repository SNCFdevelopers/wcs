# Testing an application that uses WCS

The main problem encountered when we want to test an application that uses WCS is the use of web components. For example
SeleniumHQ still doesn't support this technology very well : https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium-ide/issues/702

Writing simple tests that break through the shadow dom is therefore not always easy.

To solve this problem we recommend you to use the Playwright library (https://playwright.dev/) which really stood out
during our tests. Especially on the following points:

- Native support of the Web Components technology
- Used in production by MS on Outlook / VSCode (you can feel it in the quality of the documentation and the tooling)
- Used by other web component libraries
- Code first approach but with a test generation tool that allows to write tests as code automatically (we combine the
advantages of code and generation for the 80% of tests that can be generated with clicks)
- High quality VSCode integration
- Usable in the CI/CD with their docker image
- Allows to run tests in parallel and on multiple browsers at the same time
