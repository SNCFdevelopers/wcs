# Migrate from v3 to v4

WCS v4 contains breaking changes only in the following packages:
- wcs-core

## wcs-core

### wcs-button

- `shape="small"` doesn't exist anymore. Replace it with `size="s"`

### wcs-input

- `size` property does not set the initial size of the control anymore, but the height size of the component (`s`, `m` or `l`)
