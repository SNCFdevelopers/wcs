# Welcome to WCS developer's documentation ! 

This documentation is intended for internal wcs developers and maintainers. If you are a user of WCS (for example a developer using WCS in a project), this part of the storybook may not be relevant to you.

This part of the doc is under construction. We are working on providing more detailed information about the internal workings of WCS.

Many ressources can still be found in the CONTRIBUTING.md file of the repository.
