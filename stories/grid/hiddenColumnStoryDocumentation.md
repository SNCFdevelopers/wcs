Sometimes you need to dynamically change the columns to be displayed or not.  
For this, a `hidden` property exists on `grid-column` elements. The grid does not support deleting `grid-column` dom
elements after it has been instantiated.

This feature allows for example to let the user choose which columns they want to display or not via the interface.
