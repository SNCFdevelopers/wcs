The tabs gutter should be added for applications that use the communication design system but not for the business one.

If you add tabs in the action slot of the `wcs-action-bar` component (especially in the case of an application using the
communication's design system), you must disable the gutter of the `wcs-action-bar` component and add the gutter attribute
on the `wcs-tabs` component so that the border applies only to the length of the tabs.
