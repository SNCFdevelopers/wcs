Form fields component wraps the native input element and add some more functionnality on top of it.

You can use the `form-field` to wrap an `input`, `textarea`, `radio-group`, `switch` or a `wcs-select`.

for non supported slotted component, you can use the `required` attribute to tell the form-field that it is required. It
will add a red star after the label of the form field.
