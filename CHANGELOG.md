## [2.0.0]

### Breaking changes

- if you use form-field, the native components "input" and "textarea" are no longer supported. You have to migrate to
  the new components `wcs-input` and `wcs-textarea` (they share the same API as the native ones).
- `wcs-field-header` component has been renamed to `wcs-field-label`.

### Added

- wcs-editable-field : new component for inline data editing. for the moment the component supports the following
  components
    - wcs-input
    - wcs-text-area
    - wcs-select
- wcs-input
- wcs-textarea
