## Hacking on WCS
### StackBlitz 

For quick testing you can use these templates :
- WcsAngular + WcsFormly : https://stackblitz.com/edit/wcs-angular-template
- WcsReact : https://stackblitz.com/edit/wcs-react-template
- WcsCore only (Plain HTML) : https://stackblitz.com/edit/wcs-plain-html-template

While contributing through an issue, please link a forked StackBlitz that reproduces the bug.

### Tooling
For better productivity we recommend using the following tools:
- VScode with some extensions
    - TSlint
    - Stencil tools

### Installation
Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/SCNF/wcs.git 
cd wcs-sandbox 
npm install
```

### Running the project
```bash
npm start
# For browser compatibility you'll probably need to use this one instead,
# although it is recommended you turn on needed flags in your browser for faster build.
npm start --es5
```

### Launching the test suite
```bash
npm test
# Or in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Working on the merge request from a fork (as a maintainer)

First of all, you have to make sure that the person who created the fork allow commits from upstream members, see : https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/allow_collaboration.html#allow-commits-from-upstream-members

Then, it is possible to clone the pushed branch from the fork via origin (it is a Gitlab feature) : https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/reviews/index.html#checkout-merge-requests-locally-through-the-head-ref

> Example : `git fetch origin merge-requests/<id>/head:mr-origin-<id> && git checkout mr-origin-<id>`

Finally, if you want to push modifications (for example the result of a rebase) follow this  documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/allow_collaboration.html#push-to-the-fork-as-the-upstream-member

> Example : `git push https://gitlab.com/contributor-username/wcs local-branch:remote-branch` (add `-f` if it's a rebase).


### Doing a release

Don't forget to update the changelog and the StackBlitz templates version.

```sh
# Make sure you're on develop branch
git checkout develop
# Pull latest changes
git pull
# Build the project to make sure that all automatically generated files are up-to-date
npm run build
# Update the changelog by replacing the 'Unreleased' section with the released version number
# Commit your changes
git add . && git commit -m "chore: prepare next release" 
# Go on master
git checkout master
# Merge latest changes
git merge develop
# Do the release, we use semantic versioning for choosing release number
npm run update-version -- --version <major|minor|patch>
# Go on develop
git checkout develop
# Merge the release
git merge master
# Push the changes
git push
```
