### **OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION** ðŸ‘‰ [WCS.DEV.SNCF](https://wcs.dev.sncf)

This project is the web component implementation of the [SNCF design system](https://designmetier-bootstrap.sncf.fr/).  
It is built using  [Stencil](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil) and documented using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

If you read this documentation on GitHub, only the development branch is updated at the moment. We use the [GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/SNCF/wcs/) for WCS development and releases.

cd wcs
npm install
# To see all components
npm start
# To see only the component you're working on
npm start -- --filter select

### Test

The project uses stencil built-in facility for testing : https://stenciljs.com/docs/testing-overview.

We encourage doing TDD on functional components. To launch the tests suite simply launch :

```sh
npm run test:watch
# Or if you simply want to run them once
npm test
```

To launch a specific suite of tests you can simply launch
```sh
npm run test:e2e path_to_tests_file
# Example: you must be at the root of the project
npm run test:e2e src/components/tabs/tabs.e2e.ts
```
