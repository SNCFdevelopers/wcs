# Migrate from v4 to v5

WCS v5 contains breaking changes only in the following packages:
- wcs-core
- wcs-angular
- wcs-react

## wcs-core

### wcs-input

#### `wcsChange` event is now emitted the same way as the native `change` event

The `wcsChange` event is now emitted the same way as the native [`change` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event). Before, it was emitted at every keystroke (matching the `input`) . Now, it is emitted when the input loses focus or when the user presses the `Enter` key.

This change may cause issues if you were relying on the `wcsChange` event to be emitted at every keystroke. If you were using the `wcsChange` event to listen to every keystroke, you should now use the `wcsInput` event instead.

Angular Example:

Before :
```ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <wcs-input (wcsChange)="handleChange($event)"></wcs-input>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  handleChange(event: CustomEvent<InputChangeEventDetail>) {
    console.log('The value has changed', event.detail.value);
  }
}
```

After :
```ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <wcs-input (wcsInput)="handleChange($event)"></wcs-input>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  handleChange(event: CustomEvent<KeyboardEvent>) {
    console.log('The value has changed', event.target.value);
  }
}
```

Note that the `wcsInput` event details do not contain the value of the input, you should use `event.target.value` to get the value of the input.

#### `wcsChange` event is no longer emitted when the input value changes programmatically

The `wcsChange` event is no longer emitted when the input value changes programmatically (when you set the `value` attribute or property in js) . This change may cause issues if you were relying on the `wcsChange` event to be emitted when the input value changes programmatically.

Let's take the following scenario: a search filter is implemented with an `wcs-input`, and the search is restarted each time the wcsChange event is received. The interface offers default values via buttons; when a button is clicked, the search input value is mutated in typescript, the `wcsChange` event is fired by the `wcs-input` and the search is rerun. After our modification, the search will not be rerun, so you'll have to run the search manually in the button's click event handler.


### wcs-textarea

#### `wcsChange` event is now emitted the same way as the native `change` event

The `wcsChange` event is now emitted the same way as the native [`change` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event). Before, it was emitted at every keystroke (matching the `input` event) . Now, it is emitted when the input loses focus.

This change may cause issues if you were relying on the `wcsChange` event to be emitted at every keystroke. If you were using the `wcsChange` event to listen to every keystroke, you should now use the `wcsInput` event instead.

Angular Example:

Before :
```ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <wcs-textarea (wcsChange)="handleChange($event)"></wcs-textarea>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  handleChange(event: CustomEvent<TextareaChangeEventDetail>) {
    console.log('The value has changed', event.detail.value);
  }
}
```

After :
```ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <wcs-textarea (wcsInput)="handleChange($event)"></wcs-textarea>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  handleChange(event: CustomEvent<KeyboardEvent>) {
    console.log('The value has changed', event.target.value);
  }
}
```

Note that the `wcsInput` event details do not contain the value of the textarea, you should use `event.target.value` to get the value of the textarea.

#### `wcsChange` event is no longer emitted when the textarea value changes programmatically

The `wcsChange` event is no longer emitted when the textarea value changes programmatically (when you set the `value` attribute or property in js) . This change may cause issues if you were relying on the `wcsChange` event to be emitted when the textarea value changes programmatically.

Let's take the following scenario: we use a `wcs-textarea` to modify content with a rendering preview next to it. The preview is restarted each time the wcsChange event is received. The interface offers default values via buttons; when a button is clicked, the textarea value is mutated in typescript, the `wcsChange` event is fired by the `wcs-textarea` input and the preview is rerun. After our modification, the preview will not be rerun, so you'll have to run the preview manually in the button's click event handler.

### wcs-select

#### `wcsChange` event is now emitted the same way as the native `change` event

The `wcsChange` event is now emitted the same way as the native [`change` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event). Before, it was emitted both for user interactions and programmatically. Now, it is emitted only when the user interacts with the select.

This means that the `wcsChange` event is no longer emitted when the select value changes programmatically (when you set the `value` attribute or property in js). This change may cause issues if you were relying on the `wcsChange` event to be emitted when the select value changes programmatically.
