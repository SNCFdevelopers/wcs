# Migrate from v4 to v5

WCS v5 contains breaking changes only in the following packages:
- wcs-core
- wcs-angular
- wcs-react

## wcs-core

### Colors

Global color `--wcs-blue` used by `--wcs-primary` has changed for accessibility reasons (contrasts).
  - Old color : `#0088CE`
<span style={{color: "#0088CE"}}>■</span>
  - New color : `#0074AF`
<span style={{color: "#0074AF"}}>■</span>

**Please update your application's CSS is you are using the old "hard-coded" value.**  
**If you are already using the primitives colors `--wcs-blue` or `--wcs-primary`, you don't need to update your CSS.**

### wcs-progress-bar

- Property `small` doesn't exist anymore. Replace it with `size="s"`

### wcs-input

#### `wcsChange` event is now emitted the same way as the native `change` event

The `wcsChange` event is now emitted the same way as the native [`change` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event). Before, it was emitted at every keystroke (matching the `input`) . Now, it is emitted when the input loses focus or when the user presses the `Enter` key.

This change may cause issues if you were relying on the `wcsChange` event to be emitted at every keystroke. If you were using the `wcsChange` event to listen to every keystroke, you should now use the `wcsInput` event instead.

Angular Example:

Before :
```ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <wcs-input (wcsChange)="handleChange($event)"></wcs-input>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  handleChange(event: CustomEvent<InputChangeEventDetail>) {
    console.log('The value has changed', event.detail.value);
  }
}
```

After :
```ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <wcs-input (wcsInput)="handleChange($event)"></wcs-input>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  handleChange(event: CustomEvent<KeyboardEvent>) {
    console.log('The value has changed', event.target.value);
  }
}
```

Note that the `wcsInput` event details do not contain the value of the input, you should use `event.target.value` to get the value of the input.

#### `wcsChange` event is no longer emitted when the input value changes programmatically

The `wcsChange` event is no longer emitted when the input value changes programmatically (when you set the `value` attribute or property in js) . This change may cause issues if you were relying on the `wcsChange` event to be emitted when the input value changes programmatically.

Let's take the following scenario: a search filter is implemented with an `wcs-input`, and the search is restarted each time the wcsChange event is received. The interface offers default values via buttons; when a button is clicked, the search input value is mutated in typescript, the `wcsChange` event is fired by the `wcs-input` and the search is rerun. After our modification, the search will not be rerun, so you'll have to run the search manually in the button's click event handler.


### wcs-textarea

#### `wcsChange` event is now emitted the same way as the native `change` event

The `wcsChange` event is now emitted the same way as the native [`change` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event). Before, it was emitted at every keystroke (matching the `input` event) . Now, it is emitted when the input loses focus.

This change may cause issues if you were relying on the `wcsChange` event to be emitted at every keystroke. If you were using the `wcsChange` event to listen to every keystroke, you should now use the `wcsInput` event instead.

Angular Example:

Before :
```ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <wcs-textarea (wcsChange)="handleChange($event)"></wcs-textarea>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  handleChange(event: CustomEvent<TextareaChangeEventDetail>) {
    console.log('The value has changed', event.detail.value);
  }
}
```

After :
```ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <wcs-textarea (wcsInput)="handleChange($event)"></wcs-textarea>
  `
})
export class MyComponent {
  handleChange(event: CustomEvent<KeyboardEvent>) {
    console.log('The value has changed', event.target.value);
  }
}
```

Note that the `wcsInput` event details do not contain the value of the textarea, you should use `event.target.value` to get the value of the textarea.

#### `wcsChange` event is no longer emitted when the textarea value changes programmatically

The `wcsChange` event is no longer emitted when the textarea value changes programmatically (when you set the `value` attribute or property in js) . This change may cause issues if you were relying on the `wcsChange` event to be emitted when the textarea value changes programmatically.

Let's take the following scenario: we use a `wcs-textarea` to modify content with a rendering preview next to it. The preview is restarted each time the wcsChange event is received. The interface offers default values via buttons; when a button is clicked, the textarea value is mutated in typescript, the `wcsChange` event is fired by the `wcs-textarea` input and the preview is rerun. After our modification, the preview will not be rerun, so you'll have to run the preview manually in the button's click event handler.

### wcs-select

#### `wcsChange` event is now emitted the same way as the native `change` event

The `wcsChange` event is now emitted the same way as the native [`change` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event). Before, it was emitted both for user interactions and programmatically. Now, it is emitted only when the user interacts with the select.

This means that the `wcsChange` event is no longer emitted when the select value changes programmatically (when you set the `value` attribute or property in js). This change may cause issues if you were relying on the `wcsChange` event to be emitted when the select value changes programmatically.

### wcs-radio

#### `wcsRadioClick` is no longer emitted when the `checked` attribute changes on a `wcs-radio`

The event is still emitted when :
- you click on the radio

The event is no longer emitted when :
- you change the `checked` attribute via javascript
- you use keyboard navigation

In most case, you may listen to the  `wcsChange` event emitted from the `wcs-radio-group` parent.

### wcs-grid

#### Change the typing of `wcsGridSelectionChange` event

Before, the `wcsGridSelectionChange` event was emitted with the `row` which represents the row that was clicked.A good example of this is when you click on a row which is already selected in multiple selection mode, you received this kind of data related to the `wcsGridSelectionChange` event in `detail` property:
```typescript
{
    page: 0,
    selected: false,
    data: {
        id: 1,
        name: 'John Doe'
    }
}
```

If you wanted to know which row was selected, you had to handle your own logic which row/rows were selected. We decide to change the data of the `wcsGridSelectionChange` event to provide you the selected rows. Now, the `selectedRows` property of the `wcsGridSelectionChange` event data contains the selected row/rows in addition to the `changedRow` which represents the row that was clicked.

Now, the `wcsGridSelectionChange` event data looks like this: Single selection mode (when you click on a new row):

```typescript
{
    selectedRows: [{
        page: 0,
        selected: true,
        data: {
            id: 1,
            name: 'John Doe'
        }
    }],
    changedRow: {
        page: 0,
        selected: true,
        data: {
            id: 1,
            name: 'John Doe'
        }
    }
}
```

Multiple selection mode (when you click on a new row):
```typescript
{
    selectedRows: [
        {
            page: 0,
            selected: true,
            data: {
                id: 1,
                name: 'John Doe'
            }
        },
        {
            page: 0,
            selected: true,
            data: {
                id: 2,
                name: 'Jane Doe'
            }
        }
    ],
    changedRow: {
        page: 0,
        selected: true,
        data: {
            id: 2,
            name: 'Jane Doe'
        }
    }
}
```

Thanks to this change, you can now easily know which row/rows are selected and which row was clicked in the `wcsGridSelectionChange` event (whenever you click on a row).

Important note: On top of that, to facilitate handling which row/rows are selected, we provide a Control Value Accessor (CVA) for Angular which allows you to bind the selected rows to a form control. This way, you can easily know which row/rows are selected.

### wcs-modal

For accessibility reasons, we add a new attribute to `wcs-modal` named `modal-trigger-controls-id`. It serves as a #IDREF reference to the element that controls the modal, in order to focus the control when the modal is closed.
